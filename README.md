# String Calculator (React + TDD)

A **String Calculator** built with **React** using the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. The calculator takes a string of comma-separated numbers and returns their sum. Invalid characters are ignored, and the result is dynamically displayed.

✅ Handle multiple numbers dynamically  
✅ Ignore invalid inputs (e.g., `2,a,4` → result = `6`)

✅ Fully tested using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
